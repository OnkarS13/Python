# Python Exercise 2 - Faulty Calculator
# Your task for today is “Faulty Calculator.” As the name gives away that, our program has something to do with a calculator.

# In my upcoming exercises, you will notice that each one of them contains a scenario. 
# The reason for that is just to develop your interest in solving the problems as it is essential for you to participate in 
# these tasks as they will help you to develop logic-making skills. 
# Each of the scenarios will be totally unique and related to your interest as I know my audience. And also I have made each of the scenarios myself. 
# So, let me give a brief introduction of the scenario here.

# Scenario:
# Suppose that you are an invigilator in an exam. A calculator is not allowed for the exam. You discover somehow that students are planning to cheat in exams, using a calculator program in Python language. Somehow, you get your hands on the calculator program. Now you want to alter a few results in the calculator with your own provided results to catch the students trying to cheat using the calculator program.

# The user will provide the following inputs:

# Operator
# The two numbers between which the operator is applied
# All the results will be correct, except for these few:

# 45 * 3 = 555
# 56+9 = 77
# 56/6 = 4


# Exercise 2 - Faulty Calculator

# 45 * 3 = 555, 56+9 = 77, 56/6 = 4
# Design a calculator which will correctly solve all the problems except
# the following ones:
# 45 * 3 = 555, 56+9 = 77, 56/6 = 4
# Your program should take operator  and the two numbers as input from the user
# and then return the result
