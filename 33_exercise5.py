# Create an exercise log file for each client.
# Ask the user whether they want to log or retrieve client data.
# Write a function that takes the user input of the client's name. After the client's name is entered, it will display a message as "What you want to log- Diet or Exercise".
# Use function
# def getdate():
#            import datetime
#            return datetime.datetime.now()
# The purpose of this function is to give time with every record of food or exercise added in the file.
# Write a function to retrieve exercise or food file records for any client.
# You are advised to participate in solving this problem. This task helps you to become a good problem solver and enables you to accept the challenge and acquire new skills.
