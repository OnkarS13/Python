# Seek(), tell() & More On Python Files
# Python file objects give us many methods and attribute that we can use to analyze a file, including tools to figure out the name of 
# the file associated with the file object, whether it is closed or opened, writable, readable and how it handles errors.
# We have already discussed the file, its access modes, how to open, close, read, and write files in the previous tutorials.
# Now it is time to pay attention to some of the most useful and important functions used in file handling.

# tell()
# When we are working with python files, there are several ways to present the output of a program, it could be in human-readable form or binary form, 
# or we use read() function with specified sie to read some data.

# What if we want to know the position of the file(read/write) pointer.
# For this purpose, we use the tell() function. f.tell() returns an integer giving the file pointer current position in the 
# file represented as a number of bytes. File Pointer/File Handler is like a cursor, which defines from where the data has to be read or written in the file. 
# Sometimes it becomes important for us to know the position of the File Pointer. With the help of tell(), this task can be performed easily 


# Description:
# Syntax:  seek()
# Parameters Required: No parameters are required.
# Return Value:  seek() function returns the current position of the file pointer within the file.


# Example:
#  f = open("myfile.txt", "r")
# print(f.readline() )
# print(f.tell())


# Here the question arises, what if we want to change the position of the file pointer.
# Here the concept of seek() function comes.

# seek()
# When we open a file, the system points to the beginning of the file. Any read or write will happen from the start. To change the file object’s position, 
# use seek(offset, whence) function. The position will compute by adding offset to a reference point, and the whence argument selects the reference point. 
# It is useful when operating over an open file. If we want to read the file but skip the first 5 bytes, open the file, use function seek(5) to move to 
#  you want to start reading, and then continue reading the file.

# Description:
# Syntax:  file_pointer .seek(offset, whence).
# Offset:   In seek() function, offset is required. Offset is the position of the read/write pointer within the file.
# Whence: This is optional. It defines the point of reference. The default is 0, which means absolute file positioning.


# Value                   Meaning

# 0                       Absolute file positioning. The position is relative to the start of the file. The first argument cannot be negative.

# 1                       Seek relative to the current position. The first argument can be negative to move backward or positive to move forward

# 2                       Seek relative to the file’s end. The first argument must be negative.



# Example:
# This code will change the current file position to 5, and print the rest of the line.

# f = open("myfile.txt", "r")
# f.seek(5)
# print( f.readline() )

#  Note: not all file objects are seekable.




file = open("29_onkar.txt")
file.seek(11) # by this it will print from 11th character

print(file.tell()) # it will tell position of pointer

print(file.readline()) # it will read the line and print
# print(f.tell())

print(file.readline()) # it will read the line and print
# print(f.tell())
file.close()
