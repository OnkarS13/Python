# Python Exercise 4: Astrologer's Stars
# In todayâ€™s exercise, what we have to do is, we have to print a pattern similar to that of  a right-angle triangle, such as:

# *
# **
# ***
# ****
# You have to follow certain instructions, which are as follows:
# You have to take an integer type variable, and the input of the variable will define the length of the triangle.
# You have to declare another Boolean variable.
# When the value of Boolean is 1 i.e. True, the pattern will be printed as shown above.
# But if the value of Boolean is 0 or false, then the triangle will be printed upside down.
# If you are following my playlist and watching the Python tutorials in series, then it is a must for you to solve this problem and share your answer by commenting.

# This will enhance and increase your skills, along with boosting my morale.
